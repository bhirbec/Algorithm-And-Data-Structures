# Dynamic Programming

This is a attempt to summarize my understanding of Dynamic Programming...

# Definition 

Source from [MIT courseware](https://youtu.be/OQ5jsbhAv_M?t=1879):
- General, powerful algorithm design technique
- DP good for optimization problems
- DP ~ "Carreful Brut force"
- DP ~ "break problem into subproblems, solve subproblems, and reuse solutions"
- DP ~ "shortest path in some DAG"
- Invented by Richard Bellman (same Bellman-Ford)

5 "easy" steps to DP:
- define subproblems
- guess something
- reuse subproblem with recurence
- build an algorithm recurse + memoization or bottom-up + table
- solve the original problem
