The main areas software engineers should prepare to succeed at interview at Google:

**Algorithm Complexity:** 
- understand big-O complexity analysis

**Sorting:** 
- Quicksort 
- Merge Sort (know situations where quicksort is impractical)
- Heap Sort

**Hashtables:**
- Absolutely know how they work. 
- Be able to implement one using only arrays, in the space of one interview.

**Trees:**
- Basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. 
- Binary trees 
- n-ary trees
- Trie-trees.
- At least one type of balanced binary tree and and know how it's implemented (red/black tree, splay tree or an AVL tree). 
- Tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.

**Graphs:**  
- 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); know pros & cons. 
- BFS and DFS: computational complexity, tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code.
- Dijkstra (optional)
- A* (optional)

**Other data structures:** 
- Study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as possible. 
- Especially know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems (traveling salesman, knapsack problem), and be able to recognize them. 
- Find out what NP-complete means.
- Blum filter, Heaps?

**Mathematics:** 
- Basic discrete math (Discrete Math 101?)
- Combinatorics and probability
- Be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk (the more the better)

**Operating Systems:** 
- Know about processes, threads and concurrency issues. 
- Know what resources a processes needs and a thread needs 
- Know about locks and mutexes and semaphores and monitors and how they work. 
- Know about deadlock and livelock and how to avoid them. 
- Know how context switching works, and how it's initiated by the operating system and underlying hardware. 
- Know a little about scheduling. 
- The world is rapidly moving towards multi-core, so know the fundamentals of "modern" concurrency constructs.

**Practice for your interview:**
- [www.topcoder.com](www.topcoder.com) If you launch the "Arena" widget and then go to the practice rooms where you can play with the problems in the first/second division as a warm up.   
- [projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net).  These sites will expose you to programming problems that you would not normally come across in a standard day.
